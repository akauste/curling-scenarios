    <p>use Tactic board to draw game situations during a curling game. Drag and drop stones to sheet, and stones removed from play behind the backline.</p>
    <p>Use new... button to reset stones and to set the game type. Mixed doubles prepositioned stones can be set to correct locations.</p>
    <p>Stones can be dragged and dropped, to locations. Doubleclicking a stone (or click, to open the context menu) can be used to add shadow to current position
      to leave a mark where the stone was before moving it.
    </p>
    <p>That situation can be then turned to scenario, by providing extra information, and then describing options that team might consider.</p>
    <p>Saved scenarios can be searched from the home screen.</p>
